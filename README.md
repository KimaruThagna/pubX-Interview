Working code for task a)

### Run the app
For best experience, turn off any adblocker and preferrably use mozilla firefox

- Navigate into the `pubx/` folder by running `cd pubx/`

- Install React bootstrap by running `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

- Install dependencies by running `npm install`

- Start the application by running `npm start`

- Access the app on localhost:3000/
### Run using NGROK (Optional)
Since the prebid ads do not load on localhost, an optional approach is to download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and use it to provide a tunnel to the app.
To run ngrok, navigate to where the executable is located and run the command `./ngrok http 3000`.

This will give you an ngrok based domain you can use to access the app.
